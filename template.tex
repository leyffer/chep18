\abstract{%
    The software package PROFESSOR~\cite{Buckley:2009bj} provides machinery to
    facilitate Monte-Carlo  event-generator tuning.  The method is based on
    the numerical optimization of a goodness-of-fit  measure defined between
    measured experimental data and MC predictions. As the latter are typically
    very expensive to evaluate, PROFESSOR replaces them with fast to evaluate
    surrogates. We present improvements to the method in the numerical
    optimization as well as the surrogate construction. Firstly, we introduce
    an algorithm and implementation of a bi-level optimization problem aimed at
    improving scenarios were the underlying physics model is unable to describe
    all data to the same accuracy. Secondly, we display our implementation of
    an algorithm for multivariate rational approximations which are superior to
    the previously used polynomial surrogates.

\section{Summary and outlook}
We presented recent progress in the methodology of of Monte-Carlo event-generator tuning. A bi-level optimization strategy seems promising toward more automatic event-generator tuning, especially in the presence of mis-modelling or otherwise existing tension between data-sets. The extension of the surrogate models from ordinary polynomials to rational approximations looks promising and is expected to widen the applicability of the tuning method. The application to multi-dimensional parameter spaces will be thoroughly discussed in an upcoming publication.
